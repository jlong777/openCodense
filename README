This is an open-source version of the CODENSE algorithm:

Simply type 'make' to build the 'codense' executable. It requires a text input 
file containing a list of files, one file name (with path) per line, each one a 
data set consisting of a header line followed by mRNA expression data, i.e:

probeID        Array1Dye1      Array2Dye1      Array3Dye1      Array4Dye1 ...etc

1415671_at     10.665967       10.677811       10.463303       10.464032  ...etc
   .               .               .               .               .
   .               .               .               .               .
  etc             etc             etc             etc             etc


The first column is the specific mRNA ID, and subsequent columns are mRNA 
expression data, each of which should represent the same state for the 
organism. Other files represent the organism in different states, and it's 
best to have as many different states as possible. The first column in all 
the files needs to be identical.
CODENSE looks for groups of mRNAs that have correlated expression together 
across the set of files, or states, indicating potential modules. The output 
is a printed list of dense subgraphs in adjacency list format, see 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list.

Default pipeline parameters may be adjusted in codense.c appropriately. Any 
modules in the data must be 'on' in at least fraction SUPPORT of the different 
states. The CODENSE driver starts out with SUPPORT = 0.9, and ratchets down by 
0.1 each time until SUPPORT = 0.1.
